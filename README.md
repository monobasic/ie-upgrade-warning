#IE Upgrade Warning

![Example Screenshot](http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/3734/exampleuk.png)

The ie-upgrade-warning is a little script (8kb) that displays a warning message politely informing the user to upgrade the browser to a newer version (links to newest IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome are provided).

The webpage is still visible behind a transparent background, but access to it is prevented. The idea is to force users to upgrade from IE and avoid the website from a bad reputation that website is not rendering correctly in IE6.

This Fork is based on the allready enhanced Version by jbueza and renatocarvalo.
